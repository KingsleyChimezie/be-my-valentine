# Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
## Summary
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:  

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,  
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and  
PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.  

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
